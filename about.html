        <h1>History of NetFlix</h1>
        <p>
            Netflix was founded in 1997 by American entrepreneurs Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph. The company started as a DVD-by-mail rental service. The idea for this service came after Hastings was charged a late fee for a movie rental. Customers could subscribe to receive DVDs by mail.
            In 1998, Netflix launched its website, Netflix.com, which focused on DVD rentals and sales. The following year, the company added a subscription service, allowing customers unlimited DVD rentals at a monthly rate.
            Netflix has come a long way since its inception.

            Today, it is a streaming giant with millions of subscribers worldwide and a massive library of original content. It offers a wide range of TV series, documentaries, and feature films across various genres and languages, including original productions.
            Reed Hastings, who co-founded Netflix, was an entrepreneur who, in 1991, founded Pure Software, which made tools for software developers. Marc Randolph is a veteran Silicon Valley entrepreneur, advisor, and investor. As co-founder and founding CEO of Netflix, he laid much of the groundwork for the service that’s grown to 150 million subscribers and fundamentally altered how the world experiences media.
            Netflix's evolution from a DVD-by-mail service to a streaming giant has been a fascinating journey, marked by ups and downs, successes and failures, and innovations that have made Netflix a household name. For millions, Netflix is the de-facto place for movie and TV streaming.
